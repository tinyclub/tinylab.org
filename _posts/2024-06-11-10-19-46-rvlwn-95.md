## 内核动态

### RISC-V 架构支持

**[v2: riscv: Improve exception and system call latency](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240607061335.2197383-1-cyrilbur@tenstorrent.com/)**

> Many CPUs implement return address branch prediction as a stack. The
> RISCV architecture refers to this as a return address stack (RAS).

**[v3: vmalloc: Modify the alloc_vmap_area() error message for better diagnostics](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/8a4c62ea-f0be-1644-5c33-18072c1c82de@os.amperecomputing.com/)**

> This message is misleading because 'vmalloc=' is supported on arm32, x86
> platforms and is not a valid kernel parameter on a number of other
> platforms (in particular its not supported on arm64,alpha,loongarch,arc,
> csky,hexagon,microblaze,mips,nios2,openrisc,parisc,m64k,powerpc,riscv,sh,
> um,xtensa,s390,sparc). With the update, the output gets modified to
> include the function parameters along with the start and end of the
> virtual memory range allowed.

**[v16: riscv: sophgo: add clock support for sg2042](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/cover.1717661798.git.unicorn_wang@outlook.com/)**

> This series adds clock controller support for sophgo sg2042.

**[v1: riscv: Per-thread envcfg CSR support](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240605205658.184399-1-samuel.holland@sifive.com/)**

> This series (or equivalent) is a prerequisite for both user-mode pointer
> masking and CFI support, as those are per-thread features are controlled
> by fields in the envcfg CSR.

**[v7: Linux RISC-V IOMMU Support](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/cover.1717612298.git.tjeznach@rivosinc.com/)**

> This patch series introduces support for RISC-V IOMMU architected
> hardware into the Linux kernel.

**[v5: Add Svade and Svadu Extensions Support](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240605121512.32083-1-yongxuan.wang@sifive.com/)**

> Svade and Svadu extensions represent two schemes for managing the PTE A/D
> bit. When the PTE A/D bits need to be set, Svade extension intdicates that
> a related page fault will be raised.

**[v4: riscv: Memory Hot(Un)Plug support](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240605114100.315918-1-bjorn@kernel.org/)**

> Memory Hot(Un)Plug support (and ZONE_DEVICE) for the RISC-V port

**[v0: RISCV: Report vector unaligned accesses hwprobe](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240604162457.3757417-1-jesse@rivosinc.com/)**

> Detected if a system traps into the kernel on an vector unaligned access.
> Add the result to a new key in hwprobe.

**[v2: riscv: sophgo: add thermal sensor support for cv180x/sg200x SoCs](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/SG2PR01MB4218013241B3EED779D3BAE8D7F82@SG2PR01MB4218.apcprd01.prod.exchangelabs.com/)**

> This series implements driver for Sophgo cv180x/sg200x on-chip thermal
> sensor and adds thermal zones for CV1800B SoCs.

**[v6: Add support for a few Zc* extensions, Zcmop and Zimop](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240604124550.3214710-1-cleger@rivosinc.com/)**

> Add support for (yet again) more RVA23U64 missing extensions. Add
> support for Zimop, Zcmop, Zca, Zcf, Zcd and Zcb extensions ISA string
> parsing, hwprobe and kvm support. Zce, Zcmt and Zcmp extensions have
> been left out since they target microcontrollers/embedded CPUs and are
> not needed by RVA23U64.

**[v2: Add the core reset for UARTs of StarFive JH7110](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240604084729.57239-1-hal.feng@starfivetech.com/)**

> The UART of StarFive JH7110 needs two reset signals (apb, core) to
> initialize. This patch series adds the missing core reset.

**[v2: riscv: stacktrace: Add USER_STACKTRACE support](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240604034729.841930-1-ruanjinjie@huawei.com/)**

> Currently, userstacktrace is unsupported for riscv. So use the
> perf_callchain_user() code as blueprint to implement the
> arch_stack_walk_user() which add userstacktrace support on riscv.
> Meanwhile, we can use arch_stack_walk_user() to simplify the implementation
> of perf_callchain_user().

**[v6: RISC-V: ACPI: Add external interrupt controller support](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240601150411.1929783-1-sunilvl@ventanamicro.com/)**

> This series adds support for the below ECR approved by ASWG.
> The series primarily enables irqchip drivers for RISC-V ACPI based
> platforms.
> The series can be broadly categorized like below.


### LoongArch 架构支持

**[v1: loongarch: Only select HAVE_OBJTOOL and allow ORC unwinder if the inline assembler supports R_LARCH_{32,64}_PCREL](http://lore.kernel.org/loongarch/20240604150741.30252-1-xry111@xry111.site/)**

> GAS <= 2.41 does not support generating R_LARCH_{32,64}_PCREL for
> "label - ." and it generates R_LARCH_{ADD,SUB}{32,64} pairs instead.
> objtool cannot handle R_LARCH_{ADD,SUB}{32,64} pair in __jump_table
> (static key implementation) and etc.

**[v1: LoongArch: KVM: Discard dirty page tracking on readonly memslot](http://lore.kernel.org/loongarch/20240604121502.1985410-1-maobibo@loongson.cn/)**

> For readonly memslot such as UEFI bios or UEFI var space, guest can
> not write this memory space directly. So it is not necessary to track
> dirty pages for readonly memslot. Here there is such optimization
> in function kvm_arch_commit_memory_region().

### 进程调度

**[v1: sched: Initialize the vruntime of a new task when it is first enqueued](http://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240606121133.2218723-1-zhangqiao22@huawei.com/)**

> When create a new task, we initialize vruntime of the new task
> at sched_cgroup_fork(). However, the timing of executing this
> action is too early and may not be accurate.

**[v1: sched/fair: Prevent cpu_busy_time from exceeding actual_cpu_capacity](http://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240606070645.3295-1-xuewen.yan@unisoc.com/)**

> Because the effective_cpu_util() would return a util which
> maybe bigger than the actual_cpu_capacity, this could cause
> the pd_busy_time calculation errors.

### 内存管理

**[v1: mm: sparse: clarify a variable name and its value](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240608152114.867961-1-lsahn@wewakecorp.com/)**

> Setting 'limit' variable to 0 might seem like it means "no limit". But
> in the memblock API, 0 actually means the 'MEMBLOCK_ALLOC_ACCESSIBLE'
> enum, which limits the physical address range based on
> 'memblock.current_limit'. This can be confusing.

**[v2: mm: zswap: handle incorrect attempts to load of large folios](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240608023654.3513385-1-yosryahmed@google.com/)**

> Zswap does not support storing or loading large folios. Until proper
> support is added, attempts to load large folios from zswap are a bug.

**[v2: mm: introduce pmd/pte_needs_soft_dirty_wp helpers and utilize them](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240607211358.4660-1-21cnbao@gmail.com/)**

> This patchset introduces the pte_need_soft_dirty_wp and pmd_need_soft_dirty_wp
> helpers to determine if write protection is required for softdirty tracking.

**[v2: Introduce a store type enum for the Maple tree](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240607185257.963768-1-sidhartha.kumar@oracle.com/)**

> This series implements two work items: "aligning mas_store_gfp() with
> mas_preallocate()" and "enum for store type".

**[v7: enable bs > ps in XFS](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240607145902.1137853-1-kernel@pankajraghav.com/)**

> This is the seventh version of the series that enables block size > page size
> (Large Block Size) in XFS targetted for inclusion in 6.11.

**[v1: 6.6.y: mm: ratelimit stat flush from workingset shrinker](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/171776806121.384105.7980809581420394573.stgit@firesoul/)**

> One of our workloads (Postgres 14 + sysbench OLTP) regressed on newer
> upstream kernel and on further investigation, it seems like the cause is
> the always synchronous rstat flush in the count_shadow_nodes() added by
> the commit f82e6bf9bb9b ("mm: memcg: use rstat for non-hierarchical
> stats").

**[v1: rust: alloc: add __GFP_HIGHMEM flag](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240607-highmem-v1-1-d18c5ca4072f@google.com/)**

> Make it possible to allocate memory that doesn't need to mapped into the
> kernel's address space. This flag is useful together with
> Page::alloc_page .

**[v1: mm: zswap: add VM_BUG_ON() if large folio swapin is attempted](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240606184818.1566920-1-yosryahmed@google.com/)**

> With ongoing work to support large folio swapin, it is important to make
> sure we do not pass large folios to zswap_load() without implementing
> proper support.

**[v1: mm: zswap: limit number of zpools based on CPU and RAM](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240606165303.431215-1-flintglass@gmail.com/)**

> This patch limits the number of zpools used by zswap on smaller systems.

**[v2: mm/memblock: Add "reserve_mem" to reserved named memory at boot up](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240606150143.876469296@goodmis.org/)**

> Reserve unspecified location of physical memory from kernel command line

**[v1: support large folio swap-out and swap-in for shmem](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/cover.1717673614.git.baolin.wang@linux.alibaba.com/)**

> Shmem will support large folio allocation to get a better performance,
> however, the memory reclaim still splits the precious large folios when trying
> to swap-out shmem, which may lead to the memory fragmentation issue and can not
> take advantage of the large folio for shmeme.

**[v1: mm: introduce pmd/pte_need_soft_dirty_wp helpers for softdirty write-protect](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240606034016.82559-1-21cnbao@gmail.com/)**

> This patch introduces the pte_need_soft_dirty_wp and
> pmd_need_soft_dirty_wp helpers to determine if write protection is
> required for softdirty tracking. This can enhance code readability
> and improve its overall appearance.


**[v3: maple_tree: modified return type of mas_wr_store_entry()](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240606014656.7491-1-rgbi3307@gmail.com/)**

> Since the return value of mas_wr_store_entry() is not used,
> the return type can be changed to void.

**[v13: mm: report per-page metadata information](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240605222751.1406125-1-souravpanda@google.com/)**

> This patch adds 2 fields to /proc/vmstat that can used as shown
> below:

**[v1: mm/mm_init.c: don't initialize page->lru again](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240605221436.24627-1-richard.weiyang@gmail.com/)**

> After init_reserved_page(), we expect __init_single_page() has done its
> work to the page, which already initialize page->lru properly.

**[v1: Enable P2PDMA in Userspace RDMA](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240605192934.742369-1-martin.oliveira@eideticom.com/)**

> This patch series enables P2PDMA memory to be used in userspace RDMA
> transfers.

**[v1: ML infrastructure in Linux kernel](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240605110219.7356-1-slava@dubeyko.com/)**

> infrastructure for ML workloads and user-space drivers.

**[v2: -next: mm/hugetlb_cgroup: rework on cftypes](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240605070133.1941677-1-xiujianfeng@huawei.com/)**

> This patchset provides an intuitive view of the control files through
> static templates of cftypes, improve the readability of the code.

**[v1: mm/mm_init.c: simplify logic of deferred_[init|free]_pages](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240605010742.11667-1-richard.weiyang@gmail.com/)**

> Function deferred_[init|free]_pages are only used in
> deferred_init_maxorder(), which makes sure the range to init/free is
> within MAX_ORDER_NR_PAGES size.


**[v3: ioctl()-based API to query VMAs from /proc/<pid>/maps](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240605002459.4091285-1-andrii@kernel.org/)**

> Implement binary ioctl()-based interface to /proc/<pid>/maps file to allow
> applications to query VMA information more efficiently than reading *all* VMAs
> nonselectively through text-based interface of /proc/<pid>/maps file.

**[v6: net-next: net: ethernet: mtk_eth_soc: ppe: add support for multiple PPEs](http://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20240607082155.20021-1-eladwf@gmail.com/)**

> Add the missing pieces to allow multiple PPEs units, one for each GMAC.
> mtk_gdm_config has been modified to work on targted mac ID,
> the inner loop moved outside of the function to allow unrelated
> operations like setting the MAC's PPE index.

**[v1: CDC-NCM: add support for Apple's private interface](http://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20240607074117.31322-1-oleavr@frida.re/)**

> This private interface lacks a status endpoint, presumably because there
> isn't a physical cable that can be unplugged, nor any speed changes to
> be notified about.

**[v2: net-next: net: pse-pd: Add new PSE c33 features](http://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20240607-feature_poe_power_cap-v2-0-c03c2deb83ab@bootlin.com/)**

> Disabling bottoms halves acts as per-CPU BKL. On PREEMPT_RT code within
> local_bh_disable() section remains preemtible. As a result high prior
> tasks (or threaded interrupts) will be blocked by lower-prio task (or
> threaded interrupts) which are long running which includes softirq

### 安全增强

**[v4: batman-adv: Add flex array to struct batadv_tvlv_tt_data](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-hardening/AS8PR02MB7237205E3231CD335CB988648BFB2@AS8PR02MB7237.eurprd02.prod.outlook.com/)**

> The "struct batadv_tvlv_tt_data" uses a dynamically sized set of
> trailing elements. Specifically, it uses an array of structures of type
> "batadv_tvlv_tt_vlan_data". So, use the preferred way in the kernel
> declaring a flexible array .

### 异步 IO

**[v1: Wait on cancelations at release time](http://lore.kernel.org/io-uring/20240604191314.454554-1-axboe@kernel.dk/)**

> The idea is to ensure that we've done any fputs that we need
> to when a task using a ring exit, so that we don't leave references that
> will get put "shortly afterwards".

**[v1: io_uring: check for non-NULL file pointer in io_file_can_poll()](http://lore.kernel.org/io-uring/d79f05cf-af34-43a3-a922-63a523050216@kernel.dk/)**

> In earlier kernels, it was possible to trigger a NULL pointer
> dereference off the forced async preparation path, if no file had
> been assigned. The trace leading to that looks as follows:

### Rust For Linux

**[v2: Rust bindings for cpufreq and OPP core + sample driver](http://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/cover.1717750631.git.viresh.kumar@linaro.org/)**

> This RFC adds initial rust bindings for two subsystems, cpufreq and operating
> performance points (OPP). The bindings are provided for most of the interface
> these subsystems expose.

**[v1: Tracepoints and static branch/call in Rust](http://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/20240606-tracepoint-v1-0-6551627bf51b@google.com/)**

> An important part of a production ready Linux kernel driver is
> tracepoints. So to write production ready Linux kernel drivers in Rust,
> we must be able to call tracepoints from Rust code. This patch series
> adds support for calling tracepoints declared in C from Rust.

**[v1: arch: um: rust: Add i386 support for Rust](http://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/20240604224052.3138504-1-davidgow@google.com/)**

> At present, Rust in the kernel only supports 64-bit x86, so UML has
> followed suit.

**[v5: Rust block device driver API and null block driver](http://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/20240603191455.968301-1-nmi@metaspace.dk/)**

> This revision includes a check to validate the
> block size in the abstractions rather than in the driver. Also, the \`GenDisk\`
> type state was changed to a builder pattern.

**[v3: net::phy add unified API for C22 and C45](http://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/20240602231749.57111-1-fujita.tomonori@gmail.com/)**

> add unified API for C22 and C45, reading/writing registers and

> Currently, we are only using the linear search method to find the type id
> by the name, which has a time complexity of O(n). This change involves
> sorting the names of btf types in ascending order and using binary search,
> which has a time complexity of O(log(n)).

**[v1: bpf: don't call mmap_read_trylock() from IRQ context](http://lore.kernel.org/bpf/4b875158-1aa7-402e-8861-860a493c49cd@I-love.SAKURA.ne.jp/)**

> The "undo" pass was introduced in LLVM
> https://reviews.llvm.org/D121937
> to prevent this optimization, but it cannot cover all cases.

**[v1: ftrace: Skip __fentry__ location of overridden weak functions](http://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20240607115211.734845-1-zhengyejian1@huawei.com/)**

**[v3: bpftool: Query only cgroup-related attach types](http://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20240607111704.6716-1-tadakentaso@gmail.com/)**

> From strace and kernel tracing, I found netkit returned ENXIO and this command failed.
> I think this AttachType(BPF_NETKIT_PRIMARY) is not relevant to cgroup.

**[v11: net-next: Device Memory TCP](http://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20240607005127.3078656-1-almasrymina@google.com/)**

> attached.

**[v2: bpf-next: libbpf: BTF field iterator](http://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20240605001629.4061937-1-andrii@kernel.org/)**

> Add BTF field (type and string fields, right now) iterator support instead of
> using existing callback-based approaches, which make it harder to understand
> and support BTF-processing code.

**[v1: bpf-next: uprobe, bpf: Add session support](http://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20240604200221.377848-1-jolsa@kernel.org/)**

> this patchset is adding support for session uprobe attachment
> and using it through bpf link for bpf programs.

**[v1: bpf: Support bpf shadow stack](http://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20240604175557.1339832-1-yonghong.song@linux.dev/)**

> This works for all bpf selftests, but it is expensive.
> To avoid runtime kmalloc, we could preallocate some spaces,
> e.g., percpu pages to be used for stack. This should work
> for non-sleepable programs.

**[v1: bpf: Support shadow stack](http://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20240604175552.1339642-1-yonghong.song@linux.dev/)**
