> As suggested by the B-ext spec, the Zbc (carry-less multiplication)
> instructions can be used to accelerate CRC calculations.

**[v3: riscv: Add support for xtheadvector](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240619-xtheadvector-v3-0-bff39eb9668e@rivosinc.com/)**

> xtheadvector is a custom extension that is based upon riscv vector
> version 0.7.1 . All of the vector routines have been modified to
> support this alternative vector version based upon whether xtheadvector
> was determined to be supported at boot.

**[v1: riscv: add support for Zaamo and Zalrsc extensions](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240619153913.867263-1-cleger@rivosinc.com/)**

> Since commit e87412e621f1 ("integrate Zaamo and Zalrsc text (#1304)"),
> the A extension has been described as a set of instructions provided by
> Zaamo and Zalrsc. Add these two extensions.

**[v7: Add support for a few Zc* extensions, Zcmop and Zimop](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240619113529.676940-1-cleger@rivosinc.com/)**

> Implement support for parsing 'memmap' kernel command line parameter.

**[v1: RISC-V: Provide the frequency of mtime via hwprobe](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240618114653.12485-1-cuiyunhui@bytedance.com/)**

> The reason for merging the two parts into one patchset is mainly to
> facilitate review, especially to facilitate viewing why we need to
> improve the framework and what benefits it will bring to us.

**[v3: Add I2C support on TH1520](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240618-i2c-th1520-v3-0-3042590a16b1@bootlin.com/)**

> This adds I2C support in the device tree of the T-Head TH1520 RISCV-SoC
> and a default configuration for the BeagleV-Ahead.

**[v1: riscv: enable HAVE_ARCH_STACKLEAK](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240617123029.723-1-jszhang@kernel.org/)**

> Add support for the stackleak feature. Whenever the kernel returns to user
> space the kernel stack is filled with a poison value.

**[v1: riscv: add initial support for SpacemiT K1](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/tencent_BC64B7B1876F5D10479BD19112F73F262505@qq.com/)**

### LoongArch 架构支持

**[v1: LoongArch: KVM: Sync pending interrupt when getting ESTAT from user mode](http://lore.kernel.org/loongarch/20240620033552.2739845-1-maobibo@loongson.cn/)**

> Currently interrupt is posted and cleared with async mode, and it is saved
> in SW state vcpu::arch::irq_pending and vcpu::arch::irq_clear.

**[v1: LoongArch: Always enumerate MADT and setup logical-physical CPU mapping](http://lore.kernel.org/loongarch/20240618081630.3997018-1-chenhuacai@loongson.cn/)**

> Some drivers want to use cpu_logical_map(), early_cpu_to_node() and some
> other CPU mapping APIs, even if we use "nr_cpus=1" to hard limit the CPU
> number.

### 进程调度

**[v4: perf sched map: Add command-name, fuzzy-name options to filter the output map](http://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240618180708.14144-1-vineethr@linux.ibm.com/)**

> By default, perf sched map prints sched-in events for all the tasks
> which may not be required all the time as it prints lot of symbols
> and rows to the terminal.

**[v1: freezer,sched: Preventing kthreads with D-state from being woken up during freeze](http://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240617065755.9996-1-xuewen.yan@unisoc.com/)**

> Sometimes althought a kthread was set to be freezable, the thread's
> state also could be TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE because of some blocked
> reasons, such as msleep, wait_for_complete, mutex and so on...

### 内存管理

**[v2: tools/mm: Introduce a tool to assess swap entry allocation for thp_swapout](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240622071231.576056-1-21cnbao@gmail.com/)**

> we're rarely hitting 100% even in the worst case without "-a" and with
> "-s," which is good news!


**[v2: mm/gup: Clear the LRU flag of a page before adding to LRU batch](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/1719038884-1903-1-git-send-email-yangge1116@126.com/)**

> To solve the problem above, we modify the logic of adding to LRU batch.

**[v1: mm: rename no_progress_loops to reclaim_retries. variable no_progress_loops exectly means reclaim retry counts, renameing makes it easier to understand. and has the same style as variable compaction_retries.](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240622032817.24064-1-hushange@163.com/)**

**[v1: add support for mm-local memory allocations](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240621201501.1059948-1-rkagan@amazon.de/)**

> In a series posted a few years ago , a proposal was put forward to allow the
> kernel to allocate memory local to a mm and thus push it out of reach for
> current and future speculation-based cross-process attacks.

**[v1: hugetlb: force allocating surplus hugepages on mempolicy allowed nodes](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240621190050.mhxwb65zn37doegp@redhat.com/)**

> So allocate surplus hugepages in one of the nodes the current process belongs to.

**[v2: mm/zsmalloc: change back to per-size_class lock](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240621-zsmalloc-lock-mm-everything-v2-0-d30e9cd2b793@linux.dev/)**

**[v1: add zpdesc memory descriptor for zswap.zpool](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240621054658.1220796-1-alexs@kernel.org/)**

> According to Metthew's plan, the page descriptor will be replace by a 8
> bytes mem_desc on destination purpose.

**[v3: Improve the copy of task comm](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240621022959.9124-1-laoar.shao@gmail.com/)**

> This approach
> will facilitate future extensions to the task comm.

**[v2: filemap: add trace events for get_pages, map_pages, and fault](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240620161903.3176859-1-takayas@chromium.org/)**

> To allow precise tracking of page caches accessed, add new tracepoints
> that trigger when a process actually accesses them.

**[v2: mm: ksm: Consider the number of ksm_mm_slot in the general_profit calculation](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240620043914.249768-1-sfoon.kim@samsung.com/)**

> This patch introduces a new variable to keep track of the number of
> allocated ksm_mm_slots. By doing so, KSM will be able to provide a
> more accurate number of the gains made.

**[v2: mm/migrate: make migrate_pages_batch() stats consistent.](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240620012712.19804-1-zi.yan@sent.com/)**

> As Ying pointed out in, stats->nr_thp_failed needs to be updated to
> avoid stats inconsistency between MIGRATE_SYNC and MIGRATE_ASYNC when
> calling migrate_pages_batch().

**[v2: mm/page_alloc: Separate THP PCP into movable and non-movable categories](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/1718845190-4456-1-git-send-email-yangge1116@126.com/)**

> Since commit 5d0a661d808f ("mm/page_alloc: use only one PCP list for
> THP-sized allocations") no longer differentiates the migration type
> of pages in THP-sized PCP list, it's possible that non-movable
> allocation requests may get a CMA page from the list, in some cases,
> it's not acceptable.
