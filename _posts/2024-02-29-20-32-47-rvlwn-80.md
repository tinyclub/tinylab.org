## 内核动态

### RISC-V 架构支持

**[v2: RISC-V: enable rust](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240223-leverage-walmart-5424542cd8bd@spud/)**

> Now with a patch to disable RUST if CFI_CLANG is enabled.
> I've also intentionally not turned on the gcc support, as discussed on
> v1.
>
> As this was lifted from the state of the Rust-for-Linux tree, the commit
> messages from there cannot be preserved, so these patches have commit
> messages that I wrote.
>

**[v3: RISC-V: Ignore V from the riscv,isa DT property on older T-Head CPUs](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240223-tidings-shabby-607f086cb4d7@spud/)**

> Before attempting to support the pre-ratification version of vector
> found on older T-Head CPUs, disallow "v" in riscv,isa on these
> platforms. The deprecated property has no clear way to communicate
> the specific version of vector that is supported and much of the vendor
> provided software puts "v" in the isa string. riscv,isa-extensions
> should be used instead. This should not be too much of a burden for
> these systems, as the vendor shipped devicetrees and firmware do not
> work with a mainline kernel and will require updating.
>

**[v3: riscv: pwm: sophgo: add pwm support for CV1800](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240223082014.109385-1-qiujingbao.dlmu@gmail.com/)**

> The Sophgo CV1800 chip provides a set of four independent
> PWM channel outputs.
> This series adds PWM controller support for Sophgo cv1800.
>

**[v9: KVM: selftests: Add SEV and SEV-ES smoke tests](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240223004258.3104051-1-seanjc@google.com/)**

> Add basic SEV and SEV-ES smoke tests.  Unlike the intra-host migration tests,
> this one actually runs a small chunk of code in the guest.
>
> Unless anyone strongly objects to the quick and dirty approach I've taken for
> SEV-ES, I'll get all of this queued for 6.9 soon-ish.
>

**[v1: Introduce support for hardware break/watchpoints](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240222125059.13331-1-hchauhan@ventanamicro.com/)**

> This patchset adds support of hardware breakpoints and watchpoints
> in RISC-V architecture. The framework is built on top of perf subsystem and
> SBI debug trigger extension.
>

**[v14: Linux RISC-V AIA Support](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240222094006.1030709-1-apatel@ventanamicro.com/)**

> The RISC-V AIA specification is ratified as-per the RISC-V international
> process. The latest ratified AIA specifcation can be found at:
> https://github.com/riscv/riscv-aia/releases/download/1.0/riscv-interrupts-1.0.pdf
>

**[v9: Support Andes PMU extension](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240222083946.3977135-1-peterlin@andestech.com/)**

> This patch series introduces the Andes PMU extension, which serves the
> same purpose as Sscofpmf and Smcntrpmf. Its non-standard local interrupt
> is assigned to bit 18 in the custom S-mode local interrupt enable and
> pending registers (slie/slip), while the interrupt cause is (256 + 18).
>

**[v9: Change PWM-controlled LED pin active mode and algorithm](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240222081231.213406-1-nylon.chen@sifive.com/)**

> According to the circuit diagram of User LEDs - RGB described in the
> manual hifive-unleashed-a00.pdf[0] and hifive-unmatched-schematics-v3.pdf[1].
>
> The behavior of PWM is acitve-high.

### 进程调度

**[v2: sched: blk: Handle HMP systems when completing IO](http://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240223155749.2958009-1-qyousef@layalina.io/)**

> Due to recent changes in how topology is represented on asymmetric multi
> processing systems like big.LITTLE where all cpus share the last LLC, there is
> a performance regression as cpus with different compute capacities appear under
> the same LLC and we no longer send an IPI when the requester is running on
> a different cluster with different compute capacity.
>

**[v7: sched/fair: Check a task has a fitting cpu when updating misfit](http://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240223134825.2852766-1-qyousef@layalina.io/)**

> If a misfit task is affined to a subset of the possible cpus, we need to
> verify that one of these cpus can fit it. Otherwise the load balancer
> code will continuously trigger needlessly leading the balance_interval
> to increase in return and eventually end up with a situation where real
> imbalances take a long time to address because of this impossible
> imbalance situation.
>

**[v1: sched: Add trace_sched_waking() tracepoint to sched_ttwu_pending()](http://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240222204917.1719153-1-jstultz@google.com/)**

> Zimuzo reported seeing occasional cases in perfetto traces where
> tasks went from sleeping directly to trace_sched_wakeup()
> without always seeing a trace_sched_waking().
>

### 内存管理

**[v1: mm: Add reclaim type to memory.reclaim](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240225114204.50459-1-laoar.shao@gmail.com/)**

> In our container environment, we've observed that certain containers may
> accumulate more than 40GB of slabs, predominantly negative dentries. These
> negative dentries remain unreclaimed unless there is memory pressure. Even
> after the containers exit, these negative dentries persist. To manage disk
> storage efficiently, we employ an agent that identifies container images
> eligible for destruction once all instances of that image exit.
>

**[v12: mm/gup: Introduce memfd_pin_folios() for pinning memfd folios](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240225080008.1019653-1-vivek.kasireddy@intel.com/)**

> Currently, some drivers (e.g, Udmabuf) that want to longterm-pin
> the pages/folios associated with a memfd, do so by simply taking a
> reference on them. This is not desirable because the pages/folios
> may reside in Movable zone or CMA block.
>

**[v2: x86: disable non-instrumented version of copy_page when KMSAN is enabled](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/7f322fe9-34ba-43be-bb50-539577d1c183@I-love.SAKURA.ne.jp/)**

> I found that commit afb2d666d025 ("zsmalloc: use copy_page for full page
> copy") caused a false-positive KMSAN warning.
>

**[Patch "memcg: add refcnt for pcpu stock to avoid UAF problem in drain_all_stock()" has been added to the 5.4-stable tree](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/2024022332-splinter-handwork-bd8b@gregkh/)**

**[v5: mm/vmalloc: lock contention optimization under multi-threading](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240223130318.112198-2-rulin.huang@intel.com/)**

> When allocating a new memory area where the mapping address range is
> known, it is observed that the vmap_area lock is acquired twice.
> The first acquisition occurs in the alloc_vmap_area() function when
> inserting the vm area into the vm mapping red-black tree. The second
> acquisition occurs in the setup_vmalloc_vm() function when updating the
> properties of the vm, such as flags and address, etc.

**[v1: mm: madvise: pageout: ignore references rather than clearing young](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240223041550.77157-1-21cnbao@gmail.com/)**

> While doing MADV_PAGEOUT, the current code will clear PTE young
> so that vmscan won't read young flags to allow the reclamation
> of madvised folios to go ahead.
> It seems we can do it by directly ignoring references, thus we
> can remove tlb flush in madvise and rmap overhead in vmscan.

**[v1: mm: unify default compressor algorithm for zram/zswap](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240223035548.2591882-1-wangkefeng.wang@huawei.com/)**

> Both zram and zswap are used to reduce memory usage by compressing cold
> page, a default compressor algorithm is selected from kinds of compressor
> algorithm as the default one from very similar Kconfig, also both of
> them could change the algorithm by sysfs interfaces, so unify the
> default compressor algorithm to cleanup the default algorithm chosen.

**[v17: Drivers for Gunyah hypervisor](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240222-gunyah-v17-0-1e9da6763d38@quicinc.com/)**

> Gunyah is a Type-1 hypervisor independent of any high-level OS kernel,
> and runs in a higher CPU privilege level. It does not depend on any
> lower-privileged OS kernel/code for its core functionality. This
> increases its security and can support a much smaller trusted computing
> base than a Type-2 hypervisor. Gunyah is designed for isolated virtual
> machine use cases and to support launching trusted+isolated virtual
> machines from a relatively less trusted host virtual machine.
>

**[v2: Add log related mailbox commands](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240222172350.512-1-sthanneeru.opensrc@micron.com/)**

> Add support to expose following mailbox commands to userspace
> for clearing and populating the Vendor debug log and
> Component State dump log in certain scenarios,
> allowing for the aggregation of results over time.
>

**[v6: hugetlb: parallelize hugetlb page init on boot](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240222140422.393911-1-gang.li@linux.dev/)**

> This version is tested on mm/mm-stable.
>
> Since the release of v5, there have been some scattered discussions, they have
> primarily centered around two issues. Both of these issues have now been
> resolved, leading to the release of v6.

**[v1: mm, thp: display [never] for defrag when THP is set to never](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240222115323.4925-1-xiangzao@linux.alibaba.com/)**

> When transparent_hugepage is set to never by cmdline or echo, defrag
> still show what it used to be and can be modified which makes user
> confusing whether defrag would take effect.
>

**[v2: Fast kernel headers: split linux/mm.h](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240222115055.1172877-1-max.kellermann@ionos.com/)**

> This patch set aims to clean up the linux/mm.h header and reduce
> dependencies on it by moving parts out.
>

**[v1: mm/page_alloc: Make check_new_page return bool](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240222091932.54799-1-gehao@kylinos.cn/)**

> Make check_new_page return bool like check_new_pages

**[v2: stable: memcg: add refcnt for pcpu stock to avoid UAF problem in drain_all_stock()](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240222030237.82486-1-gongruiqi1@huawei.com/)**

> commit 1a3e1f40962c445b997151a542314f3c6097f8c3 upstream.
>
> NOTE: This is a partial backport since we only need the refcnt between
> memcg and stock to fix the problem stated below, and in this way
> multiple versions use the same code and align with each other.
