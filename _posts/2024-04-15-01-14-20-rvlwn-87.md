## 内核动态

### RISC-V 架构支持

**[v2: of: property: Add fw_devlink support for interrupt-map property](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240413091942.316054-1-apatel@ventanamicro.com/)**

> Some of the PCI controllers (such as generic PCI host controller)
> use "interrupt-map" DT property to describe the mapping between
> PCI endpoints and PCI interrupt pins. This the only case where
> the interrupts are not described in DT.
>

**[v10: Add timer driver for StarFive JH7110 RISC-V SoC](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240412084543.7243-1-ziv.xu@starfivetech.com/)**

> This patch serises are to add timer driver for the StarFive JH7110
> RISC-V SoC. The first patch adds documentation to describe device
> tree bindings. The subsequent patch adds timer driver and support
> JH7110 SoC. The last patch adds device node about timer in JH7110
> dts.
>

**[v8: riscv: sophgo: add dmamux support for Sophgo CV1800/SG2000 SoCs](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/IA1PR20MB495359880A3A8C4947702BB5BB042@IA1PR20MB4953.namprd20.prod.outlook.com/)**

> Add dma multiplexer support for the Sophgo CV1800/SG2000 SoCs.
>
> As the syscon device of CV1800 have a usb phy subdevices. The
> binding of the syscon can not be complete without the usb phy
> is finished. As a result, the binding of syscon is removed
> and will be evolved in its original series after the usb phy
> binding is fully explored.
>

**[v4: Support Zve32[xf] and Zve64[xfd] Vector subextensions](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240412-zve-detection-v4-0-e0c45bb6b253@sifive.com/)**

> The series composes of two parts. The first part provides a quick fix for
> the issue on a recent thread[1]. The issue happens when a platform has
> ununified vector register length across multiple cores. Specifically,
> patch 1 adds a comment at a callsite of riscv_setup_vsize to clarify how
> vlenb is observed by the system. Patch 2 fixes the issue by failing the
> boot process of a secondary core if vlenb mismatches.
>

**[v4: mm: jit/text allocator](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240411160051.2093261-1-rppt@kernel.org/)**

> Since v3 I looked into making execmem more of an utility toolbox, as we
> discussed at LPC with Mark Rutland, but it was getting more hairier than
> having a struct describing architecture constraints and a type identifying
> the consumer of execmem.
>

**[v6: RISC-V SBI v2.0 PMU improvements and Perf sampling in KVM guest](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240411000752.955910-1-atishp@rivosinc.com/)**

> This series implements SBI PMU improvements done in SBI v2.0[1] i.e. PMU snapshot
> and fw_read_hi() functions.
>
> SBI v2.0 introduced PMU snapshot feature which allows the SBI implementation
> to provide counter information (i.e. values/overflow status) via a shared
> memory between the SBI implementation and supervisor OS. This allows to minimize
> the number of traps in when perf being used inside a kvm guest as it relies on
> SBI PMU + trap/emulation of the counters.
>

**[v5: riscv: hwprobe: export highest virtual userspace address](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240410144558.1104006-1-cleger@rivosinc.com/)**

> Some userspace applications (OpenJDK for instance) uses the free MSBs
> in pointers to insert additional information for their own logic and
> need to get this information from somewhere. Currently they rely on
> parsing /proc/cpuinfo "mmu=svxx" string to obtain the current value of
> virtual address usable bits [1].
>

**[v3: riscv: improve nommu and timer-clint](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240410142347.964-1-jszhang@kernel.org/)**

> As is known, the sophgo CV1800B contains so called little core, which
> is C906 w/o MMU, so I want to run nommu linux on it. This series is
> the result of the bring up. After this series, w/ proper dts, we can
> run nommu linux on milkv duo's little core.
>

**[v3: add initial Milk-V Duo S board support](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240410062254.2955647-1-michael.opdenacker@bootlin.com/)**

> This adds an initial device tree for the Milk-V Duo S board.
> Last tested on linux-next as a May 9, 2024.
>

**[v4: Add notifier for PLL0 clock and set it 1.5GHz on](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240410033148.213991-1-xingyu.wu@starfivetech.com/)**

> This patch is to add the notifier for PLL0 clock and set the PLL0 rate
> to 1.5GHz to fix the lower rate of CPUfreq on the JH7110 SoC.
>

**[v3: RISC-V: enable rust](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240409-unsaddle-skittle-c93eb77732bb@spud/)**

> I've intentionally not turned on the gcc support, as discussed on
> v1. I've also switched over to using the target, but it is a bit heavier
> than the one arm64 seems to be using. RISC-V has fewer targets available
> and this was the closest. I preserved the redzone disabling, just moved
> into the Makefile.
>

**[v3: RISC-V: Test th.sxstatus.MAEE bit before enabling MAEE](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240407213236.2121592-1-christoph.muellner@vrull.eu/)**

> Currently, the Linux kernel suffers from a boot regression when running
> on the c906 QEMU emulation. Details have been reported here by Bj&#246;rn T&#246;pel:
>   https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2024-01/msg04766.html
>

**[v8: RESEND: riscv: add initial support for Canaan Kendryte K230](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/tencent_22BA0425B4DF1CA1713B62E4423C1BFBF809@qq.com/)**

> K230 is an ideal chip for RISC-V Vector 1.0 evaluation now. Add initial
> support for it to allow more people to participate in building drivers
> to mainline for it.

### 进程调度

**[v2: sched/topology: Optimize topology_span_sane()](http://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240410213311.511470-1-kyle.meyer@hpe.com/)**

> A soft lockup is being detected in build_sched_domains() on 32 socket
> Sapphire Rapids systems with 3840 processors.
>

**[v2: net-next: net: sched: cake: Optimize the number of function calls and branches in heap construction](http://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240408174716.751069-1-visitorckw@gmail.com/)**

> When constructing a heap, heapify operations are required on all
> non-leaf nodes. Thus, determining the index of the first non-leaf node
> is crucial.
>

### 内存管理

**[v2: mm/shrinker: add SHRINKER_NO_DIRECT_RECLAIM](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240413015410.30951-1-lipeifeng@oppo.com/)**

> In the case of insufficient memory, threads will be in direct_reclaim to
> reclaim memory, direct_reclaim will call shrink_slab to run sequentially
> each shrinker callback.
>

**[v6: IOMMU memory observability](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240413002522.1101315-1-pasha.tatashin@soleen.com/)**

> Description
> IOMMU subsystem may contain state that is in gigabytes. Majority of that
> state is iommu page tables. Yet, there is currently, no way to observe
> how much memory is actually used by the iommu subsystem.
>

**[v6: mm/madvise: enhance lazyfreeing with mTHP in madvise_free](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240413002219.71246-1-ioworker0@gmail.com/)**

> This patchset adds support for lazyfreeing multi-size THP (mTHP) without
> needing to first split the large folio via split_folio(). However, we
> still need to split a large folio that is not fully mapped within the
> target range.
>

**[v6: mm: add per-order mTHP alloc and swpout counters](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240412114858.407208-1-21cnbao@gmail.com/)**

> The patchset introduces a framework to facilitate mTHP counters, starting
> with the allocation and swap-out counters. Currently, only four new nodes
> are appended to the stats directory for each mTHP size.
>

**[v2: slub: Clear __GFP_COMP flag when allocating 0 order page](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240412095431.612839-1-haifeng.xu@shopee.com/)**

> We encounter warning messages when failing to create a new slab like
> this:
>
> page allocation failure: order:0, mode:0x1004000(GFP_NOWAIT|__GFP_COMP),
> nodemask=(null)
>

**[v3: mm: batch mm counter updating in filemap_map_pages()](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240412064751.119015-1-wangkefeng.wang@huawei.com/)**

> Let's batch mm counter updating to accelerate filemap_map_pages().
>

**[v2: tracing: Add sched_prepare_exec tracepoint](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240411102158.1272267-1-elver@google.com/)**

> Add "sched_prepare_exec" tracepoint, which is run right after the point
> of no return but before the current task assumes its new exec identity.
>

**[v14: mm/gup: Introduce memfd_pin_folios() for pinning memfd folios](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240411070157.3318425-1-vivek.kasireddy@intel.com/)**

> Currently, some drivers (e.g, Udmabuf) that want to longterm-pin
> the pages/folios associated with a memfd, do so by simply taking a
> reference on them. This is not desirable because the pages/folios
> may reside in Movable zone or CMA block.
>

**[v5: transfer page to folio in KSM](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240411061713.1847574-1-alexs@kernel.org/)**

> This is the first part of page to folio transfer on KSM. Since only
> single page could be stored in KSM, we could safely transfer stable tree
> pages to folios.
> This patchset could reduce ksm.o 57kbytes from 2541776 bytes on latest
> akpm/mm-stable branch with CONFIG_DEBUG_VM enabled. It pass the KSM testing
> in LTP and kernel selftest.

**[v2: exfat: move extend valid_size into ->page_mkwrite()](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-fsdevel/PUZPR04MB63160EDE1B2FB47D80B717D481002@PUZPR04MB6316.apcprd04.prod.outlook.com/)**

> It is not a good way to extend valid_size to the end of the
> mmap area by writing zeros in mmap. Because after calling mmap,
> no data may be written, or only a small amount of data may be
> written to the head of the mmap area.

### 网络设备

**[v2: net-next: Read PHY address of switch from device tree on MT7530 DSA subdriver](http://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20240414-b4-for-netnext-mt7530-phy-addr-from-dt-and-simplify-core-ops-v2-0-1a7649c4d3b6@arinc9.com/)**

> This patch series makes the driver read the PHY address the switch listens
> on from the device tree which, in result, brings support for MT7530
> switches listening on a different PHY address than 31. And the patch series
> simplifies the core operations.

**[v7: net-next: virtio_net: Support RX hash XDP hint](http://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20240413041035.7344-1-liangchen.linux@gmail.com/)**

> The RSS hash report is a feature that's part of the virtio specification.
> Currently, virtio backends like qemu, vdpa (mlx5), and potentially vhost
> (still a work in progress as per [1]) support this feature. While the
> capability to obtain the RSS hash has been enabled in the normal path,
> it's currently missing in the XDP path. Therefore, we are introducing
> XDP hints through kfuncs to allow XDP programs to access the RSS hash.

> We've observed a 7-12% performance regression in iperf3 UDP ipv4 and
> ipv6 tests with multiple sockets on Zen3 cpus, which we traced back to
> commit f0ea27e7bfe1 ("udp: re-score reuseport groups when connected

> Patch 1 :- This patch takes care of only renaming the mono delivery
> timestamp to tstamp_type with no change in functionality of
> existing available code in kernel also
> Starts assigning tstamp_type with either mono or real and
> introduces a new enum in the skbuff.h, again no change in functionality
