## 内核动态

### RISC-V 架构支持

**[v8: riscv: sophgo: add clock support for Sophgo CV1800/SG2000 SoCs](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/IA1PR20MB4953366482FEBFC5E7F6F34BBB4F2@IA1PR20MB4953.namprd20.prod.outlook.com/)**

> To perform well on short messages, the new implementation processes the
> full message in one call to the assembly function if the data is
> contiguous.  Otherwise it falls back to CBC operations followed by CTS
> at the end.  For decryption, to further improve performance on short
> messages, especially block-aligned messages, the CBC-CTS assembly
> function parallelizes the AES decryption of all full blocks.
>

**[v11: riscv: Create and document PR_RISCV_SET_ICACHE_FLUSH_CTX prctl](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240212-fencei-v11-0-e1327f25fe10@rivosinc.com/)**

> Improve the performance of icache flushing by creating a new prctl flag
> PR_RISCV_SET_ICACHE_FLUSH_CTX. The interface is left generic to allow
> for future expansions such as with the proposed J extension [1].
>
> Documentation is also provided to explain the use case.
>

**[v2: riscv: pwm: sophgo: add pwm support for CV1800](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240212121729.1086718-1-qiujingbao.dlmu@gmail.com/)**

> The Sophgo CV1800 chip provides a set of four independent
> PWM channel outputs.
> This series adds PWM controller support for Sophgo cv1800.
>

**[v2: riscv/fence: Consolidate fence definitions and define __{mb,rmb,wmb}](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240212105946.1241100-1-ericchancf@google.com/)**

> Disparate fence implementations are consolidated into fence.h.
>
> Introduce __{mb,rmb,wmb}, and rely on the generic definitions
> for {mb,rmb,wmb}. A first consequence is that __{mb,rmb,wmb}
> map to a compiler barrier on !SMP (while their definition remains
> unchanged on SMP).
>

**[v1: riscv: Various text patching improvements](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240212025529.1971876-1-samuel.holland@sifive.com/)**

> Here are a few changes to minimize calls to stop_machine() and
> flush_icache_*() in the various text patching functions, as well as
> to simplify the code.
>

**[v2: RISC-V: Add dynamic TSO support](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240209064050.2746540-1-christoph.muellner@vrull.eu/)**

> The upcoming RISC-V Ssdtso specification introduces a bit in the senvcfg
> CSR to switch the memory consistency model of user mode at run-time from
> RVWMO to TSO. The active consistency model can therefore be switched on a
> per-hart base and managed by the kernel on a per-process base.
>

**[v1: clk: renesas: rzg2l: Add support for power domains](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240208124300.2740313-1-claudiu.beznea.uj@bp.renesas.com/)**

> Series adds support for power domains on rzg2l driver.
>
> RZ/G2L kind of devices support a functionality called MSTOP (module
> stop/standby). According to hardware manual the module could be switch
> to standby after its clocks are disabled. The reverse order of operation
> should be done when enabling a module (get the module out of standby,
> enable its clocks etc).
>

**[v1: -next: RISC-V: ACPI: Enable CPPC based cpufreq support](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240208034414.22579-1-sunilvl@ventanamicro.com/)**

> This series enables the support for "Collaborative Processor Performance
> Control (CPPC) on ACPI based RISC-V platforms. It depends on the
> encoding of CPPC registers as defined in RISC-V FFH spec [2].
>

**[GIT PULL: percpu changes for v6.8-rc4](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/ZcQtvkrWhIkRVfS9@snowbird/)**

> The PR to enable the percpu page allocator had a tlb flush parameter
> mixup of end vs size.. This contains the fix.
>

**[v2: riscv: sophgo: add i2c and spi device to CV180x/SG2000x SoCs](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/IA1PR20MB49539A9C5F5CFF6644ED2C2ABB442@IA1PR20MB4953.namprd20.prod.outlook.com/)**

> Add i2c and spi devices
>
> The patch depends on the clk patch:
> https://lore.kernel.org/all/IA1PR20MB4953C774D41EDF1EADB6EC18BB6D2@IA1PR20MB4953.namprd20.prod.outlook.com/

**[v1: RISC-V: Don't use IPIs in flush_icache_all() when patching text](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240205042955.833752-1-apatel@ventanamicro.com/)**

> If some of the HARTs are parked by stop machine then IPI-based
> flushing in flush_icache_all() will hang. This hang is observed
> when text patching is invoked by various debug and BPF features.

### 进程调度

**[v1: sched: make cpu_util_cfs visible](http://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240211074950.247836-1-zhaoyang.huang@unisoc.com/)**

> As RT, DL, IRQ time could be deemed as lost time of CFS's task, some
> timing value want to know the distribution of how these spread
> approximately by using utilization account value (nivcsw is not enough
> sometimes), wheras, cpu_util_cfs is not visible out side of
> kernel/sched, This commit would like to make it be visible.
>

**[v2: sched/debug: Dump end of stack when detected corrupted](http://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240207143523.438816-1-feng.tang@intel.com/)**

> When debugging a kernel hang during suspend/resume [1], there were random
> memory corruptions in different places like being reported by
> slub_debug+KASAN, or detected by scheduler with error message
>

**[v2: perf sched: Minor optimizations for resource initialization](http://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240206083228.172607-1-yangjihong1@huawei.com/)**

> start_work_mutex, work_done_wait_mutex, curr_thread, curr_pid, and
> cpu_last_switched are initialized together in cmd_sched(),
> but for different perf sched subcommands, some actions are unnecessary,
> especially perf sched record.
> This series of patches initialize only required resources for different
> subcommands.
>

**[v2: net-next: net/sched: actions report errors with extack](http://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240205185537.216873-1-stephen@networkplumber.org/)**

> When an action detects invalid parameters, it should
> be adding an external ack to netlink so that the user is
> able to diagnose the issue.
>

**[v1: sched: cpufreq: Rename map_util_perf to apply_dvfs_headroom](http://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240205022006.2229877-1-qyousef@layalina.io/)**

> We are providing headroom for the utilization to grow until the next
> decision point to pick the next frequency. Give the function a better
> name and give it some documentation. It is not really mapping anything.

### 内存管理

**[v1: hugetlb: two small improvements of hugetlb init parallelization](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240213111347.3189206-1-gang.li@linux.dev/)**

> This series includes two improvements: fixing the PADATA Kconfig warning
> and a potential bug in gather_bootmem_prealloc_parallel. Please refer to
> the specific commit message for details.
>

**[v2: enable bs > ps in XFS](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240213093713.1753368-1-kernel@pankajraghav.com/)**

> This is the second version of the series that enables block size > page size
> (Large Block Size) in XFS. This version has various bug fixes and suggestion
> collected from the v1[1]. The context and motivation can be seen in cover
> letter of the v1. We also recorded a talk about this effort at LPC [2],
> if someone would like more context on this effort.
>

**[v5: per-vma locks in userfaultfd](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240213001920.3551772-1-lokeshgidra@google.com/)**

> Performing userfaultfd operations (like copy/move etc.) in critical
> section of mmap_lock (read-mode) causes significant contention on the
> lock when operations requiring the lock in write-mode are taking place
> concurrently. We can use per-vma locks instead to significantly reduce
> the contention issue.
>

**[v3: Memory allocation profiling](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240212213922.783301-1-surenb@google.com/)**

> Memory allocation, v3 and final:
>
> Overview:
> Low overhead [1] per-callsite memory allocation profiling. Not just for debug
> kernels, overhead low enough to be deployed in production.
>

**[v1: mm: document memalloc_noreclaim_save() and memalloc_pin_save()](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240212182950.32730-2-vbabka@suse.cz/)**

> The memalloc_noreclaim_save() function currently has no documentation
> comment, so the implications of its usage are not obvious. Namely that
> it not only prevents entering reclaim (as the name suggests), but also
> allows using all memory reserves and thus should be only used in
> contexts that are allocating memory to free memory. This may lead to new
> improper usages being added.
>

**[v4: Enable >0 order folio memory compaction](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240212163510.859822-1-zi.yan@sent.com/)**

> This patchset enables >0 order folio memory compaction, which is one of
> the prerequisitions for large folio support[1]. It is on top of
> mm-everything-2024-02-10-00-56.
>

**[v3: kasan: add atomic tests](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240212083342.3075850-1-paul.heidekrueger@tum.de/)**

> Test that KASan can detect some unsafe atomic accesses.
>
> As discussed in the linked thread below, these tests attempt to cover
> the most common uses of atomics and, therefore, aren't exhaustive.
>

**[v2: Port hierarchical_{memory,swap}_limit cgroup1->cgroup2](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/ZcmaPqZ9HzoN0GFM@host1.jankratochvil.net/)**

> which are useful for userland to easily and performance-wise find out the
> effective cgroup limits being applied. Otherwise userland has to
> open+read+close the file "memory.max" and/or "memory.swap.max" in multiple
> parent directories of a nested cgroup.
>

**[v1: mm/zswap: optimize for dynamic zswap_pools](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240210-zswap-global-lru-v1-0-853473d7b0da@bytedance.com/)**

> Dynamic pool creation has been supported for a long time, which maybe
> not used so much in practice. But with the per-memcg lru merged, the
> current structure of zswap_pool's lru and shrinker become less optimal.
>

**[v1: x86/vdso: Move vDSO to mmap region](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240210091827.work.233-kees@kernel.org/)**

> The vDSO (and its initial randomization) was introduced in commit
> 2aae950b21e4 ("x86_64: Add vDSO for x86-64 with gettimeofday/clock_gettime/getcpu"),
> but had very low entropy. The entropy was improved in commit
> but there is still improvement to be made.
>

**[v2: mm/memory: optimize unmap/zap with PTE-mapped THP](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240209221509.585251-1-david@redhat.com/)**

> This series is based on [1]. Similar to what we did with fork(), let's
> implement PTE batching during unmap/zap when processing PTE-mapped THPs.
>
> We collect consecutive PTEs that map consecutive pages of the same large
> folio, making sure that the other PTE bits are compatible, and (a) adjust
> the refcount only once per batch, (b) call rmap handling functions only
> once per batch, (c) perform batch PTE setting/updates and (d) perform TLB
> entry removal once per batch.
>

**[v1: selftests/mm: Don't needlessly use sudo to obtain root in run_vmtests.sh](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240209-kselftest-mm-check-deps-v1-1-19b09b151522@kernel.org/)**

> When opening yama/ptrace_scope we unconditionally use sudo to ensure we
> are running as root, resulting in failures if running in a minimal root
> filesystem where sudo is not installed. Since automated test systems will
> typically just run all of kselftest as root (and many kselftests rely on
> this for full functionality) add a check to see if we're already root and
> only invoke sudo if not.
>

**[v1: mm/hugetlb: Move page order check inside hugetlb_cma_reserve()](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240209054221.1403364-1-anshuman.khandual@arm.com/)**

> All platforms could benefit from page order check against MAX_PAGE_ORDER
> before allocating a CMA area for gigantic hugetlb pages. Let's move this
> check from individual platforms to generic hugetlb.
>

**[v2: bpf-next: bpf: Introduce BPF arena.](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240209040608.98927-1-alexei.starovoitov@gmail.com/)**

> The work on bpf_arena was inspired by Barret's work:
> https://github.com/google/ghost-userspace/blob/main/lib/queue.bpf.h
> that implements queues, lists and AVL trees completely as bpf programs
> using giant bpf array map and integer indices instead of pointers.
> bpf_arena is a sparse array that allows to use normal C pointers to
> build such data structures. Last few patches implement page_frag
> allocator, link list and hash table as bpf programs.

**[v1: mm/memblock: Add MEMBLOCK_RSRV_NOINIT into flagname[] array](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240209030912.1382251-1-anshuman.khandual@arm.com/)**

> The commit 77e6c43e137c ("memblock: introduce MEMBLOCK_RSRV_NOINIT flag")
> skipped adding this newly introduced memblock flag into flagname[] array,
> thus preventing a correct memblock flags output for applicable memblock
> regions.

**[v2: Memory management patches needed by Rust Binder](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240208-alice-mm-v2-0-d821250204a6@google.com/)**

> This patchset contains some abstractions needed by the Rust
> implementation of the Binder driver for passing data between userspace,
> kernelspace, and directly into other processes.
>

**[v1: fs/proc/task_mmu: Add display flag for VM_MAYOVERLAY](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240208084805.1252337-1-anshuman.khandual@arm.com/)**

> VM_UFFD_MISSING flag is mutually exclussive with VM_MAYOVERLAY flag as they
> both use the same bit position i.e 0x00000200 in the vm_flags. Let's update
> show_smap_vma_flags() to display the correct flags depending on CONFIG_MMU.

### 异步 IO

**[v1: -next: io_uring: switch struct io_kiocb flag definitions to BIT_ULL()](http://lore.kernel.org/io-uring/1960190f37b94276df50d382b9f1488cd6b6e662.1707226862.git.geert+renesas@glider.be/)**

> The io_kiocb.flags variable was expanded to 64 bits, but none of the
> existing or newly-added flag definitions were updated, causing build
> issues on 32-bit platforms, where unsigned long is a 32-bit value.

**[v1: liburing: add script for statistics sqpoll running time](http://lore.kernel.org/io-uring/20240206024014.11412-1-xiaobing.li@samsung.com/)**

> Count the running time and actual IO processing time of the sqpoll

### Rust For Linux

**[v2: rust: locks: Add `get_mut` method to `Lock`](http://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/20240212-rust-locks-get-mut-v2-1-5ccd34c2b70b@gmail.com/)**

> Having a mutable reference guarantees that no other threads have
> access to the lock, so we can take advantage of that to grant callers
> access to the protected data without the the cost of acquiring and
> releasing the locks. Since the lifetime of the data is tied to the
> mutable reference, the borrow checker guarantees that the usage is safe.

**[v1: bcachefs: add framework for internal Rust code](http://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/20240207055558.611606-1-tahbertschinger@gmail.com/)**

> This series adds support for Rust code into bcachefs. This only enables
> using Rust internally within bcachefs; there are no public Rust APIs
> added. Rust support is hidden behind a new config option,
> CONFIG_BCACHEFS_RUST. It is optional and bcachefs can still be built
> with full functionality without rust.

**[v3: rust: place generated init_module() function in .init.text](http://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/20240206153806.567055-1-tahbertschinger@gmail.com/)**

> Currently Rust kernel modules have their init code placed in the `.text`
> section of the .ko file. I don't think this causes any real problems
> for Rust modules as long as all code called during initialization lives
> in `.text`.

**[v1: rust: stop using ptr_metadata feature](http://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/20240205091842.2858516-1-aliceryhl@google.com/)**

> The `byte_sub` method was stabilized in Rust 1.75.0. By using that
> method, we no longer need the unstable `ptr_metadata` feature for
> implementing `Arc::from_raw`.
