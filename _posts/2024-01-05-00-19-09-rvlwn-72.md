## 内核动态

### RISC-V 架构支持

**[v2: riscv: Add Zicbop & prefetchw support](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20231231082955.16516-1-guoren@kernel.org/)**

> This patch series adds Zicbop support and then enables the Linux
> prefetchw feature. It's based on v6.7-rc7.
>

**[GIT PULL: KVM/riscv changes for 6.8 part #1](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/CAAhSdy1QsMuAmr+DFxjkf3a2Ur91AX9AnddRnBHGM6+exkAn1g@mail.gmail.com/)**

> We have the following KVM RISC-V changes for 6.8:
> 1) KVM_GET_REG_LIST improvement for vector registers
> 2) Generate ISA extension reg_list using macros in get-reg-list selftest
> 3) Steal time account support along with selftest
>

**[v1: Enable SPCR table for console output on RISC-V](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20231229065405.235625-1-jeeheng.sia@starfivetech.com/)**

> This patch will enable the SPCR table for RISC-V.
>
> Vendor will enable/disable the SPCR table in the firmware based on the
> platform design. However, in cases where the SPCR table is not usable,
> a kernel parameter could be used to specify the preferred console.
>

**[v1: riscv: dts: sophgo: add watchdog dt node for CV1800](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/DM6PR20MB23160B8499CC2BFDAE6FCACDAB9EA@DM6PR20MB2316.namprd20.prod.outlook.com/)**

> Add the watchdog device tree node to cv1800 SoC.
> This patch depends on the clk driver and reset driver.
> Clk driver link:

**[v1: riscv: tlb: avoid tlb flushing on exit & execve](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20231228084642.1765-1-jszhang@kernel.org/)**

> The mmu_gather code sets fullmm=1 when tearing down the entire address
> space for an mm_struct on exit or execve. So if the underlying platform
> supports ASID, the tlb flushing can be avoided because the ASID
> allocator will never re-allocate a dirty ASID.
>

**[v1: Add driver for Cadence SD6HC SD/eMMC controller](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20231228065322.1176351-1-yuklin.soo@starfivetech.com/)**

> Starfive JH8100 SoC consists of a Cadence SD/eMMC host controller
> (Version 6) with Combo PHY which provides DFI interface to SD/eMMC
> removable or embedded devices. This patch adds initial SD/eMMC support
> for JH8100 SoC by providing device drivers for Cadence SD/eMMC Version 6
> host controller and Combo PHY.  This patch series is depending on the
> JH8100 base patch series in [1], [2], and [3].
> The relevant dt-bindings documentation has been updated accordingly.
>

**[v2: Unified cross-architecture kernel-mode FPU API](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20231228014220.3562640-1-samuel.holland@sifive.com/)**

> This series unifies the kernel-mode FPU API across several architectures
> by wrapping the existing functions (where needed) in consistently-named
> functions placed in a consistent header location, with mostly the same
> semantics: they can be called from preemptible or non-preemptible task
> context, and are not assumed to be reentrant. Architectures are also
> expected to provide CFLAGS adjustments for compiling FPU-dependent code.
> For the moment, SIMD/vector units are out of scope for this common API.
>

**[v1: dt-bindings: riscv: cpus: Clarify mmu-type interpretation](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20231227175739.1453782-1-samuel.holland@sifive.com/)**

> The current description implies that only a single address translation
> mode is available to the operating system. However, some implementations
> support multiple address translation modes, and the operating system is
> free to choose between them.
>

**[v14: riscv: Add fine-tuned checksum functions](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20231227-optimize_checksum-v14-0-ddfd48016566@rivosinc.com/)**

> Each architecture generally implements fine-tuned checksum functions to
> leverage the instruction set. This patch adds the main checksum
> functions that are used in networking. Tested on QEMU, this series
> allows the CHECKSUM_KUNIT tests to complete an average of 50.9% faster.
>

**[v5: riscv: sophgo: add clock support for Sophgo CV1800 SoCs](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/IA1PR20MB49539CDAD9A268CBF6CA184BBB9FA@IA1PR20MB4953.namprd20.prod.outlook.com/)**

> Add clock controller support for the Sophgo CV1800B and CV1812H.
>
> This patch follow this patch series:

**[v1: irqchip/sifive-plic: One function call less in __plic_init() after error detection](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/71aebecb-ab59-4835-9320-10e849c04a5c@web.de/)**

> Date: Tue, 26 Dec 2023 21:34:47 +0100
>
> The kfree() function was called in one case by the
> __plic_init() function during error handling
> even if the passed data structure member contained a null pointer.
> This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.

**[v1: Basic clock and reset support for StarFive JH8100 RISC-V SoC](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20231226053848.25089-1-jeeheng.sia@starfivetech.com/)**

> This patch series enabled basic clock & reset support for StarFive
> JH8100 SoC.
>
> This patch series depends on the Initial device tree support for
> StarFive JH8100 SoC patch series which can be found at [1].
>

**[v6: Support Andes PMU extension](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20231225103308.1557548-1-peterlin@andestech.com/)**

> This patch series introduces the Andes PMU extension, which serves
> the same purpose as Sscofpmf. To use FDT-based probing for hardware
> support of the PMU extensions, we first convert T-Head's PMU to CPU
> feature alternative, then add Andes PMU alternatives.
>

**[v4: riscv: enable EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS and DCACHE_WORD_ACCESS](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20231225044207.3821-1-jszhang@kernel.org/)**

> Some riscv implementations such as T-HEAD's C906, C908, C910 and C920
> support efficient unaligned access, for performance reason we want
> to enable HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS on these platforms. To
> avoid performance regressions on non efficient unaligned access
> platforms, HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS can't be globally selected.
>

**[v1: riscv: Improve exception and system call latency](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20231225040018.1660554-1-antonb@tenstorrent.com/)**

> Many CPUs implement return address branch prediction as a stack. The
> RISCV architecture refers to this as a return address stack (RAS). If
> this gets corrupted then the CPU will mispredict at least one but
> potentally many function returns.

**[v1: mm: ratelimit stat flush from workingset shrinker](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20231228073055.4046430-1-shakeelb@google.com/)**

> One of our internal workload regressed on newer upstream kernel and on
> further investigation, it seems like the cause is the always synchronous
> rstat flush in the count_shadow_nodes() added by the commit f82e6bf9bb9b
> ("mm: memcg: use rstat for non-hierarchical stats"). On further
> inspection it seems like we don't really need accurate stats in this
> function as it was already approximating the amount of appropriate
> shadow entried to keep for maintaining the refault information. Since
> there is already 2 sec periodic rstat flush, we don't need exact stats
> here. Let's ratelimit the rstat flush in this code path.

> The first two patches were previously reviewed but not yet merged.

**[v8: GenieZone hypervisor drivers](http://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20231228105147.13752-1-yi-de.wu@mediatek.com/)**

> This series is based on linux-next, tag: next-20231222.

> GenieZone hypervisor(gzvm) is a type-1 hypervisor that supports various virtual
> machine types and provides security features such as TEE-like scenarios and
> secure boot. It can create guest VMs for security use cases and has
> virtualization capabilities for both platform and interrupt. Although the
> hypervisor can be booted independently, it requires the assistance of GenieZone
> hypervisor kernel driver(gzvm-ko) to leverage the ability of Linux kernel for
> vCPU scheduling, memory management, inter-VM communication and virtio backend
> support.

> In mctp set_link_af implementation `mctp_set_link_af`, it uses strict

> This patch series changes the include list of string.c to minimize

> This series focuses on enabling the Serial Port Console Redirection (SPCR)
