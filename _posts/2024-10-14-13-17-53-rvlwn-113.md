> Here are 2 important fixes and a code improvement to the T-Head TH1520
> pinctrl driver that was either introduced or missed when Drew took over
> upstreaming it.

**[v10: Add support for Allwinner PWM on D1/T113s/R329 SoCs](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20241011102751.153248-1-privatesub2@gmail.com/)**

**[v10: Tracepoints and static branch in Rust](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20241011-tracepoint-v10-0-7fbde4d6b525@google.com/)**

> This patch series
> adds support for calling tracepoints declared in C from Rust.
> This series includes a patch that adds a user of tracepoits to the
> rust_print sample.

**[v3: ftrace: Consolidate ftrace_regs accessor functions for archs using pt_regs](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20241010202114.2289f6fd@gandalf.local.home/)**

> TL;DR: Eliminate KVM's long-standing (and heinous) behavior of essentially
> guessing which pfns are refcounted pages (see kvm_pfn_to_refcounted_page()).

**[v5: Add board support for Sipeed LicheeRV Nano](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20241010-sg2002-v5-0-a0f2e582b932@bootlin.com/)**

> Software with larger attack surfaces (e.g. network facing apps like databases,
> browsers or apps relying on browser runtimes) suffer from memory corruption
> issues which can be utilized by attackers to bend control flow of the program
> to eventually gain control (by making their payload executable).

**[v3: Introduce support for T-head TH1520 Mailbox](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20241008174852.222374-1-m.wilczynski@samsung.com/)**

> While working with the T-Head 1520 LicheePi4A SoC, certain conditions
> arose that allowed me to reproduce a race issue in the sdhci code.
> To solve this issue, we need to clear pending interrupts when resetting
> host->pending_reset. This ensures that after sdhci_threaded_irq restores
> interrupts, there are no pending stale interrupts.

**[v3: pwm: Add pwm driver for Sophgo SG2042](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/cover.1728355974.git.unicorn_wang@outlook.com/)**

> The current code subtracts the value of curr from avg_vruntime and avg_load
> during runtime. Then, every time avg_vruntime() is called, it adds the
> value of curr to the avg_vruntime and avg_load.

**[v1: sched/topology: improve topology_span_sane speed](http://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20241010155111.230674-1-steve.wahl@hpe.com/)**

> Use a different approach to topology_span_sane(), that checks for the
> same constraint of no partial overlaps for any two CPU sets for
> non-NUMA topology levels, but does so in a way that is O(N) rather
> than O(N^2).

**[v1: sched/core: Disable page allocation in task_tick_mm_cid()](http://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20241010014432.194742-1-longman@redhat.com/)**

> task_tick_mm_cid() may cause the following splat.

**[v3: sched+mm: Track lazy active mm existence with hazard pointers](http://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20241008135034.1982519-1-mathieu.desnoyers@efficios.com/)**

>   I'm posting a v3 taking care of feedback from Peter Zijlstra and Paul
>   E. McKenney in case it can be useful to try hazard pointers with other
>   use-cases, or for further benchmarking of active mm tracking impact.

**[v1: sched: Lazy preemption muck](http://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20241007074609.447006177@infradead.org/)**

> When HVO is enabled and huge page memory allocs are made, the freed memory
> can be aggregated into higher order memory in the following paths, which
> facilitates further allocs for higher order memory.

**[v1: Reduce dependence on vmas deep in hugetlb allocation code](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/cover.1728684491.git.ackerleytng@google.com/)**

> removing the need to pass a struct vma pointer when taking a folio
> from the global pool (i.e. dequeue_hugetlb_folio_vma()).

**[v2: vmscan: add a vmscan event for reclaim_pages](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20241011124928.1224813-1-jaewon31.kim@samsung.com/)**

> The reclaim_folio_list uses a dummy reclaim_stat and is not being
> used. To know the memory stat, add a new trace event. This is useful how
> how many pages are not reclaimed or why.

**[v1: mm/page_alloc: Let GFP_ATOMIC order-0 allocs access highatomic reserves](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20241011120737.3300370-1-matt@readmodwrite.com/)**

> Under memory pressure it's possible for GFP_ATOMIC order-0 allocations
> to fail even though free pages are available in the highatomic reserves.
> GFP_ATOMIC allocations cannot trigger unreserve_highatomic_pageblock()
> since it's only run from reclaim.

**[v2: introduce PIDFD_SELF* sentinels](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/cover.1728643714.git.lorenzo.stoakes@oracle.com/)**

> This series introduces sentinels for this purposes which can be passed as

> where THP (and more precisely, PMD mappings) are supposed to be disabled.
> While it works as expected for anon+shmem, the pagecache is the problematic
> bit.

**[v1: mm: Split BLK_FEAT_SYNCHRONOUS and SWP_SYNCHRONOUS_IO into separate read and write flags](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20241011091133.28173-1-qun-wei.lin@mediatek.com/)**

> This patch splits the BLK_FEAT_SYNCHRONOUS feature flag into two
> separate flags: BLK_FEAT_READ_SYNCHRONOUS and

> The tmpfs could support large folio, but there is some configurable
> options(mount options and runtime deny/force) to enable/disable large
> folio allocation, so there is a performance issue when perform write
> without large folio, the issue is similar to commit 4e527d5841e2
> ("iomap: fault in smaller chunks for non-large folio mappings").

**[v1: RFC/RFT: Converge common flows for cpu assisted shadow stack](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20241010-shstk_converge-v1-0-631beca676e7@rivosinc.com/)**

> x86, arm64 and risc-v support cpu assisted shadow stack. x86 was first
> one and most of the shadow stack related code is in x86 arch directory.
> arm64 guarded control stack (GCS) patches from Mark Brown are in -next.

**[v3: tip/perf/core: uprobes,mm: speculative lockless VMA-to-uprobe lookup](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20241010205644.3831427-1-andrii@kernel.org/)**

> As shown above, the test_memcg used about 100M swap, but 600M+ swap memory
> was used, which means that 500M may be wasted because other memcgs can not
> use these swap memory.
> To fix this issue, it's better to stop looping if THP has been splited and
> nr_pageout is greater than nr_to_reclaim.
