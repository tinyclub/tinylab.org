## 内核动态

### RISC-V 架构支持

**[GIT PULL: RISC-V Patches for the 6.11 Merge Window, Part 1](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/mhng-099fa737-a1fc-466d-bf27-9ad62173bb45@palmer-ri-x1c9/)**

> Here's my resolution of the actual diff, we could delete the functions but with
> more incoming I figured it was best to avoid sticking extra diff in the merge:

**[v1: cache: StarFive: Require a 64-bit system](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240719163841.19018-1-palmer@rivosinc.com/)**

> This has a bunch of {read,write}q() calls, so it won't work on 32-bit
> systems.

**[v3: riscv/purgatory: align riscv_kernel_entry](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240719170437.247457-1-cyrevolt@gmail.com/)**

> This has been tested on a JH7110 SoC with oreboot and its SBI delegating
> unaligned access exceptions and the kernel configured to handle them.

**[v5: riscv: Add support for xtheadvector](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240719-xtheadvector-v5-0-4b485fc7d55f@rivosinc.com/)**

> xtheadvector is a custom extension that is based upon riscv vector
> version 0.7.1 [1]. All of the vector routines have been modified to
> support this alternative vector version based upon whether xtheadvector
> was determined to be supported at boot.

**[v3: riscv: Separate vendor extensions from standard extensions](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240719-support_vendor_extensions-v3-0-0af7587bbec0@rivosinc.com/)**

> There is currently one vendor extension, xandespmu, but
> it is likely that more vendor extensions will be added to the kernel in
> the future.

**[v1: riscv: spacemit: add pinctrl support to K1 SoC](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240719-02-k1-pinctrl-v1-0-239ac5b77dd6@gentoo.org/)**

> This series adds pinctrl support to SpacemiT's K1 SoC which
> has feature compatible with pinctrl-single driver, then later
> add pinctrl property for Bananapi-F3 uart device.

**[v5: mmc: sdhci-of-dwcmshc: Add Sophgo SG2042 support](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/cover.1721377374.git.unicorn_wang@outlook.com/)**

> When I tried to add a new soc(SG2042) to sdhci-of-dwcmshc, I found
> that the existing driver code could be optimized to facilitate expansion
> for the new soc.

**[v1: RISC-V: Implement kgdb_roundup_cpus() to enable IPI KGDB Roundup](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240719081210.1457512-1-ruanjinjie@huawei.com/)**

> A custom one allows to debug CPUs that are stuck with interrupts
> disabled. And using an IPI is better than the generic one since it avoids
> the potential situation described in the generic kgdb_call_nmi_hook().

**[v1: Add perf support to collect KVM guest statistics from host side](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/cover.1721271251.git.zhouquan@iscas.ac.cn/)**

> Add basic guest support to RISC-V perf, enabling it to distinguish
> whether PMU interrupts occur in the host or the guest, and then
> collect some basic guest information from the host side
> (guest os callchain is not supported for now).

**[v2: RISC-V: Enable IPI CPU Backtrace](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240718093659.158912-1-takakura@valinux.co.jp/)**

> Add arch_trigger_cpumask_backtrace() which is a generic infrastructure
> for sampling other CPUs' backtrace using IPI.

**[v1: riscv/mm/fault: add show_pte() before die()](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240718020935.12803-1-cuiyunhui@bytedance.com/)**

> When the kernel displays "Unable to handle kernel paging request at
> virtual address", we would like to confirm the status of the virtual
> address in the page table. So add show_pte() before die().

**[v3: riscv: Per-thread envcfg CSR support](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240718004808.2246354-1-samuel.holland@sifive.com/)**

> This series (or equivalent) is a prerequisite for both user-mode pointer
> masking and CFI support, as both of those are per-thread features and
> are controlled by fields in the envcfg CSR.

**[v1: mm: THP-agnostic refactor on huge mappings](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240717220219.3743374-1-peterx@redhat.com/)**

> This is an RFC series, so not yet for merging.  Please don't be scared by
> the code changes: most of them are code movements only.

**[v5: RISC-V: Detect and report speed of unaligned vector accesses](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240717180727.4180475-1-jesse@rivosinc.com/)**

> Adds support for detecting and reporting the speed of unaligned vector
> accesses on RISC-V CPUs.

> This is a known issue [1] so let's upgrade the minimal requirement for
> LLVM to the version 17.0.0, which is the first version to contain the
> fix.

**[v1: RISC-V: hwprobe: sort EXT_KEY()s in hwprobe_isa_ext0() alphabetically](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240717-dedicate-squeamish-7e4ab54df58f@spud/)**

> Currently the entries appear to be in a random order (although according
> to Palmer he has tried to sort them by key value) which makes it harder
> to find entries in a growing list, and more likely to have conflicts as
> all patches are adding to the end of the list. Sort them alphabetically
> instead.

**[v2: riscv: add tracepoints for page fault](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240717082728.84401-1-zhuhengbo@iscas.ac.cn/)**

> Introduce page_fault_user and page_fault_kernel for riscv page fault.
> Help to get more detail information when page fault happen.

**[v3: Zacas/Zabha support and qspinlocks](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240717061957.140712-1-alexghiti@rivosinc.com/)**

> This implements [cmp]xchgXX() macros using Zacas and Zabha extensions
> and finally uses those newly introduced macros to add support for
> qspinlocks: note that this implementation of qspinlocks satisfies the
> forward progress guarantee.

**[v2: RISC-V: Enable the IPI before workqueue_online_cpu()](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240717031714.1946036-1-nick.hu@sifive.com/)**

> Sometimes the hotplug cpu stalls at the arch_cpu_idle() for a while after
> workqueue_online_cpu(). When cpu stalls at the idle loop, the reschedule
> IPI is pending.

**[v1: mm: introduce numa_memblks](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240716111346.3676969-1-rppt@kernel.org/)**

> Following the discussion about handling of CXL fixed memory windows on
> arm64 [1] I decided to bite the bullet and move numa_memblks from x86 to
> the generic code so they will be available on arm64/riscv and maybe on
> loongarch sometime later.

**[v4: riscv: sophgo: add thermal sensor support for cv180x/sg200x SoCs](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/SEYPR01MB422158B2766DA03728AD90CBD7A22@SEYPR01MB4221.apcprd01.prod.exchangelabs.com/)**

> milkv-duo and cv1812h SoC for milkv-duo256m

**[v1: net-next: Add the dwmac driver support for T-HEAD TH1520 SoC.](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240713-thead-dwmac-v1-0-81f04480cd31@tenstorrent.com/)**

> I am marking this as an RFC since it has been almost a year since the
> previous series and Jisheng has handed it off to me.

> Function kvm_arch_para_features() is to detect supported para features,
> it can be used by device driver to detect and enable para features,
> such as extioi irqchip driver to detect KVM_FEATURE_VIRT_EXTIOI.

**[v5: LoongArch: Add AVEC irqchip support](http://lore.kernel.org/loongarch/20240715033440.26506-1-zhangtianyang@loongson.cn/)**

> Introduce the advanced extended interrupt controllers. This feature will
> allow each core to have 256 independent interrupt vectors and MSI
> interrupts can be independently routed to any vector on any CPU.

### ARM 架构支持

**[v3: phy: mvebu-cp110-utmi: add support for armada-380 utmi phys](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/20240720-a38x-utmi-phy-v3-0-4c16f9abdbdc@solid-run.com/)**

> cope with the new format.

**[v3: Add support for Firefly Core-PX30-JD4 SoM & baseboard](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/20240718-rockchip-px30-firefly-v3-0-3835cdd22eae@collabora.com/)**

> perf_tools__fill_defaults are removed.

**[v6: io-pgtable-arm + drm/msm: Extend iova fault debugging](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/20240717163627.43423-1-robdclark@gmail.com/)**

> This series extends io-pgtable-arm with a method to retrieve the page
> table entries traversed in the process of address translation, and then
> beefs up drm/msm gpu devcore dump to include this (and additional info)
> in the devcore dump.

**[v2: rtc: stm32: add pinctrl interface to handle RTC outs](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/20240717074835.2210411-1-valentin.caron@foss.st.com/)**

> With the new __counted_by annotation, the "lli_size" variable needs to
> valid for accesses to the "lli" array. This requirement is not met in
> stm32_dma3_chan_desc_alloc(), since "lli_size" starts at "0", so "lli"
> index "0" will not be considered valid during the initialization for loop.

### X86 架构支持
