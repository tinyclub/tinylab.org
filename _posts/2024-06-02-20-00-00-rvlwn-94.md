> control as their phy didn't support it*. I was surprised to see that none
> of the other musb drivers made any use of this, but there is handling
> in the musb core for it - made me feel like I was missing something as
> to why it was not used by other drivers.

**[v1: Revert "riscv: mm: accelerate pagefault when badaccess"](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240530164451.21336-1-palmer@rivosinc.com/)**

> I found that some tasks have been running for a long enough time and
> have become illegal, but they are still not releasing the CPU. This
> will increase the scheduling delay of other processes. Therefore, I
> tried checking the current process in wakeup_preempt and entity_tick,
> and if it is illegal, reschedule that cfs queue.

**[v1: sched: core: quota and parent_quota can be uninitialized and assigned values](http://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240528115350.1927-1-zeming@nfschina.com/)**

> If there are not enough nodes, mas_node_count() set an error state via mas_set_err()
> and return control flow to the beginning.
> In the return flow, mas_nomem() checks the error status, allocates new nodes,
> and resumes execution again.

**[v4: slab: Introduce dedicated bucket allocator](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240531191304.it.853-kees@kernel.org/)**

**[v1: mm: read page_type using READ_ONCE](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240531125616.2850153-1-david@redhat.com/)**

> Let's use READ_ONCE to avoid load tearing (shouldn't make a difference)
> and to make KCSAN happy.
> Likely, we might also want to use WRITE_ONCE for the writer side of
> page_type, if KCSAN ever complains about that. But we'll not mess with
> that for now.

**[v1: mm: sparse: Consistently use _nr](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240531124144.240399-1-dev.jain@arm.com/)**

**[v1: mm/memory-failure: Stop setting the folio error flag](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240531032938.2712870-1-willy@infradead.org/)**

> Nobody checks the error flag any more, so setting it accomplishes
> nothing.  Remove the obsolete parts of this comment; it hasn't
> been true since errseq_t was used to track writeback errors in 2017.

**[v3: vmstat: Kernel stack usage histogram](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240530170259.852088-1-pasha.tatashin@soleen.com/)**

> Provide a kernel stack usage histogram to aid in optimizing kernel stack
> sizes and minimizing memory waste in large-scale environments. The
> histogram divides stack usage into power-of-two buckets and reports the
> results in /proc/vmstat. This information is especially valuable in
> environments with millions of machines, where even small optimizations
> can have a significant impact.

**[v1: mm: store zero pages to be swapped out in a bitmap](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240530102126.357438-1-usamaarif642@gmail.com/)**

> As shown in the patchseries that introduced the zswap same-filled
> optimization [1], 10-20% of the pages stored in zswap are same-filled.
> This is also observed across Meta's server fleet.
> By using VM counters in swap_writepage (not included in this
> patchseries) it was found that less than 1% of the same-filled
> pages to be swapped out are non-zero pages.

**[v3: add mTHP support for anonymous shmem](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/cover.1717033868.git.baolin.wang@linux.alibaba.com/)**

> Anonymous pages have already been supported for multi-size (mTHP) allocation
> through commit 19eaf44954df, that can allow THP to be configured through the
> sysfs interface located at '/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/hugepage-XXkb/enabled'.

**[v1: mm: vmscan: reset sc->priority on retry](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240529154911.3008025-1-shakeel.butt@linux.dev/)**

> The commit 6be5e186fd65 ("mm: vmscan: restore incremental cgroup
> iteration") added a retry reclaim heuristic to iterate all the cgroups
> before returning an unsuccessful reclaim but missed to reset the
> sc->priority. Let's fix it.

**[v6: enable bs > ps in XFS](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240529134509.120826-1-kernel@pankajraghav.com/)**

**[v2: mm: page_type, zsmalloc and page_mapcount_reset()](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240529111904.2069608-1-david@redhat.com/)**

> Wanting to remove the remaining abuser of _mapcount/page_type along with
> page_mapcount_reset(), I stumbled over zsmalloc, which is yet to be
> converted away from "struct page".

**[v5: large folios swap-in: handle refault cases first](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240529082824.150954-1-21cnbao@gmail.com/)**

> This patch is extracted from the large folio swapin series[1], primarily addressing
> the handling of scenarios involving large folios in the swap cache.

**[v1: mm/hugetlb: Do not call vma_add_reservation upon ENOMEM](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240528205323.20439-1-osalvador@suse.de/)**

> sysbot reported a splat [1] on __unmap_hugepage_range().
> Check for that and do not call vma_add_reservation() if that is the case,
> otherwise region_abort() and region_del() will see that we do not have any
> file_regions.


**[v4: percpu_counter: add a cmpxchg-based _add_batch variant](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240528204257.434817-1-mjguzik@gmail.com/)**

> Interrupt disable/enable trips are quite expensive on x86-64 compared to
> a mere cmpxchg (note: no lock prefix!) and percpu counters are used
> quite often.

**[v2: memcg: rearrange fields of mem_cgroup_per_node](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240528164050.2625718-1-shakeel.butt@linux.dev/)**

> Kernel test robot reported [1] performance regression for will-it-scale
> test suite's page_fault2 test case for the commit 70a64b7919cb ("memcg:
> dynamically allocate lruvec_stats"). After inspection it seems like the
> commit has unintentionally introduced false cache sharing.

> The cited commit missed to check against the validity of the length
> and various pointers on the XDP buff metadata in the tap_get_user_xdp()
> path, which could cause a corrupted skb to be sent downstack. For
> instance, tap_get_user() prohibits short frame which has the length
> less than Ethernet header size from being transmitted, while the
> skb_set_network_header() in tap_get_user_xdp() would set skb's
> network_header regardless of the actual XDP buff data size. This
> could either cause out-of-bound access beyond the actual length, or
> confuse the underlayer with incorrect or inconsistent header length
