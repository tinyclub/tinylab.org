> provenance becomes a little tricky to ascertain after this - please forgive
> any omissions!)  - rather than locating the guard pages at the VMA layer,
> instead placing them in page tables mapping the required ranges.

> down in the function -- including messing up COW, page table handling
> and accounting.

**[v3: mm/madvise: unrestrict process_madvise() for current process](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240926151019.82902-1-lorenzo.stoakes@oracle.com/)**

**[v1: Userspace Can Control Memory Failure Recovery](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240924043924.3562257-1-jiaqiyan@google.com/)**

> Recently there is an enforcement on the userspace control over how kernel

> This is caused by the -Zfunction-return=thunk-extern flag in rustc not
> properly informing LLVM about the mitigation, which means that the KASAN

> to sigqueue() as it can send a signal along with a cookie to a thread or
> thread group.

**[v1: bpf: Call kfree(obj) only once in free_one()](http://lore.kernel.org/bpf/08987123-668c-40f3-a8ee-c3038d94f069@web.de/)**

**[v2: bpf-next: bpf: Add kfuncs for read-only string operations](http://lore.kernel.org/bpf/cover.1727335530.git.vmalik@redhat.com/)**

**[v3: bpf-next: Support eliding map lookup nullness](http://lore.kernel.org/bpf/cover.1727174358.git.dxu@dxuuu.xyz/)**

> lookup keys. In other words, if the verifier can statically prove that
> the lookup will be in-bounds, allow the prog to drop the null check.

**[v1: net-next: virtio-net: support AF_XDP zero copy (tx)](http://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20240924013204.13763-1-xuanzhuo@linux.alibaba.com/)**
