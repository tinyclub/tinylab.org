### RISC-V 架构支持

**[v1: arch: riscv: thead: implement basic spi](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240630063845.116307-1-kanakshilledar@gmail.com/)**

> implemented basic spi support for TH1520 SoC.
> created a fixed clock and a simple spi0 node.
> updated the matching binding to include thead,th1520-spi as compatible.
> added a spidev device in devicetree which will utilise the spi0 node.

**[v4: Tracepoints and static branch in Rust](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240628-tracepoint-v4-0-353d523a9c15@google.com/)**

> An important part of a production ready Linux kernel driver is
> tracepoints.

**[v1: riscv: signal: abstract header saving for setup_sigcontext](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240628-dev-signal-refactor-v1-1-0c391b260261@sifive.com/)**

> The function save_v_state() served two purposes.

**[v1: riscv: vector: treat VS_INITIAL as discard](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240628-dev-vstate_discard-v1-1-18e1c5d7997e@sifive.com/)**

> The purpose of riscv_v_vstate_discard() is to invalidate v context at
> entries of syscalls.

**[v2: riscv: ftrace: atmoic patching and preempt improvements](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240628-dev-andyc-dyn-ftrace-v4-v2-0-1e5f4cb1f049@sifive.com/)**

> SpacemiT K1 is an ideal chip for some new extension such as RISC-V Vector
> 1.0 and Zicond evaluation now. Add initial support for it to allow more
> people to participate in building drivers to mainline for it.

**[v2: riscv: entry: always initialize regs->a0 to -ENOSYS](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240627142338.5114-2-CoelacanthusHex@gmail.com/)**

> Otherwise when the tracer changes syscall number to -1, the kernel fails
> to initialize a0 with -ENOSYS and subsequently fails to return the error
> code of the failed syscall to userspace.

**[v2: Zacas/Zabha support and qspinlocks](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240626130347.520750-1-alexghiti@rivosinc.com/)**

> from partial merges.

**[v1: riscv: uaccess: optimizations](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240625040500.1788-1-jszhang@kernel.org/)**

> This series tries to optimize riscv uaccess in the following way:

**[v1: riscv: Randomize lower bits of stack address](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240625030502.68988-1-cuiyunhui@bytedance.com/)**

**[v3: RISC-V: Detect and report speed of unaligned vector accesses](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240625005001.37901-1-jesse@rivosinc.com/)**

> The vec_misaligned_speed key keeps the same format
> as the scalar unaligned access speed key.

**[v2: RISC-V: cmdline: Add support for 'memmap' parameter](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240624123739.43604-1-cuiyunhui@bytedance.com/)**

> Add parsing of 'memmap' to use or reserve a specific region of memory.

**[v2: irqchip/sifive-plic: ensure interrupt is enable before EOI](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240624113523.23-1-zhengyan@asrmicro.com/)**

> This harmonizes all virtual addressing modes which can now all map
> (PGDIR_SIZE * PTRS_PER_PGD) / 4 of physical memory.

**[v2: clk: thead: Add support for TH1520 AP_SUBSYS clock controller](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240623-th1520-clk-v2-0-ad8d6432d9fb@tenstorrent.com/)**

> Add support for the stackleak feature. Whenever the kernel returns to user
> space the kernel stack is filled with a poison value.

**[v1: riscv: allwinner: ClockworkPi and DevTerm devicetrees](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20240622150731.1105901-1-wens@kernel.org/)**

> Here are a couple patches that were originally sent by Samuel, but later
> dropped due to the system LDO regulator bindings not getting merged. The
> regulator bindings were recently resent and landed [1], so now is the time
> to get the rest of the stragglers in.


### LoongArch 架构支持

**[v1: LoongArch: uprobes: make UPROBE_SWBP_INSN/UPROBE_XOLBP_INSN constant](http://lore.kernel.org/loongarch/20240627160255.GA25374@redhat.com/)**

> LoongArch defines UPROBE_SWBP_INSN as a function call and this breaks
> arch_uprobe_trampoline() which uses it to initialize a static variable.

**[v4: LoongArch: KVM: Add Binary Translation extension support](http://lore.kernel.org/loongarch/20240626063239.3722175-1-maobibo@loongson.cn/)**
