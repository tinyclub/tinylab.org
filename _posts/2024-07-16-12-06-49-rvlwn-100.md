**[v1: mm/x86/pat: Only untrack the pfn range if unmap region](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240712144244.3090089-1-peterx@redhat.com/)**

> This patch is one patch of an old series [1] that got reposted standalone
> here, with the hope to fix some reported untrack_pfn() issues reported
> recently [2,3], where there used to be other fix [4] but unfortunately
> which looks like to cause other issues.

> The legacy PMD-sized THP counters at /proc/vmstat include

> currently mostly used by BPF subsystem, with support for working in sleepable
> mode in which memory faults are allowed and can be relied upon to fetch
> relevant parts of ELF file to find and fetch .note.gnu.build-id information.

**[v1: mm/cma: export total and free number of pages for CMA areas](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20240709163053.2514760-1-fvdl@google.com/)**

### Rust For Linux

**[v4: Rust bindings for cpufreq and OPP core + sample driver](http://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/cover.1720680252.git.viresh.kumar@linaro.org/)**

> This adds initial rust bindings for two subsystems, cpufreq and operating
> performance points (OPP). The bindings are provided for most of the interface
> these subsystems expose.

**[v1: drm: panthor: add dev_coredumpv support](http://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/20240710225011.275153-1-daniel.almeida@collabora.com/)**

> Dump the state of the GPU. This feature is useful for debugging purposes.

> As the usage of `ARef` and `AlwaysRefCounted` is growing, it makes sense
> to add explanation of the "ARef pattern" to cover the most "DO" and "DO
> NOT" cases when wrapping a self-refcounted C type.

**[v2: Support several Rust toolchain versions](http://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/20240709160615.998336-1-ojeda@kernel.org/)**

> A few things improved here and there, and rebased on top of `rust-next`.

**[v2: drm/panic: Add a qr_code panic screen](http://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/20240709084458.158659-1-jfalempe@redhat.com/)**

> This series adds a new panic screen, with the kmsg data embedded in a QR-code.

> is set bpf_overflow_handler() should be invoked to execute the attached bpf
> program.

**[v16: net-next: Device Memory TCP](http://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20240710001749.1388631-1-almasrymina@google.com/)**

**[v14: Reduce overhead of LSMs with static calls](http://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20240710000500.208154-1-kpsingh@kernel.org/)**

> LSM hooks (callbacks) are currently invoked as indirect function calls. These
> callbacks are registered into a linked list at boot time as the order of the
> LSMs can be configured on the kernel command line with the "lsm=" command line
> parameter.
