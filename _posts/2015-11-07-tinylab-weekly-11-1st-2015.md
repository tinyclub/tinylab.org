## [Anandtech：iPhone 6s 和 iPhone 6s Plus 评测报告](http://anandtech.com/show/9686/the-apple-iphone-6s-and-iphone-6s-plus-review)

> With yet another round of architectural improvements and a clockspeed approaching 2GHz, comparing Apple’s CPU designs to Intel’s is less rhetorical than ever before.

可能是技术最深度的评测报告，过瘾的 A9 芯片解读

<br/>

## [The Information: Google 考虑自己设计芯片](https://www.theinformation.com/with-apple-in-mind-google-seeks-android-chip-partners)

> Google recently talked with some microchip makers about developing chips based on Google's own preferred designs

> That, Google hopes, would make its Android mobile operating system more competitive with Apple’s phones at the high end of the market and solve other major problems.

如 A 系列芯片之于 iOS；优化 Android 生态的垂直整合水平

<br/>

## [Intel OTC: 我们做到了 Chrome OS 图形管线上的纹理零拷贝](https://01.org/zh/blogs/2015/zero-copy-texture-uploads-chrome-os)

> Native zero-copy in Intel architecture is always beneficial in both performance measurements and memory consumption measurements that we performed.

领略 Chrome OS 图形管线；内核 DRM 子系统与 dma-buf 框架之舞；CPU 与 GPU 统一寻址、HSA（Heterogeneous System Architecture）之小犀利

顺便说一句，Chrome OS 并入 Android 流言已由 Google 出面辟谣

<br/>

## [Phoronix.com: NVIDIA 似蓄势待发 Vulkan 驱动](http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NVIDIA-Vulkan-Nearing-Release)

> NVIDIA is readying their Vulkan drivers for a same-day release and on the Windows side they've already begun exposing some of the Vulkan interface. 

次世代图形编程接口，OpenGL 接班人，这么快就来了

<br/>

## [Phoronix.com: 触摸板 协议及 Weson 支持之开发再启动](http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Tablet-Revised-For-Wayland)

> Peter Hutterer is back to working on tablet protocol and support for Wayland/Weston.

移动互联时代，UI 交互之基础技术正发生积极变革。比如 Vulkan 替代 OpenGL，还有开源的 Wayland/Weston Stack 替代 Xorg

<br/>

## [LKML: Btrfs 在 Linux 4.4 开发版本有许多改进](http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1511.0/04360.html)

> The Btrfs file-system in Linux 4.4 has a number of sub-volume quota improvements, many code clean-ups, and a number of allocator fixes based upon their usage at Facebook

Btrfs 被认为是 Linux 下一代文件系统，采用类似 ZFS COW 而非日志的可靠性机理。目前正在 FB 规模试用

<br/>

## [LKML: Linux Kernel Library 让应用使用 Kernel 代码](http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1511.0/01898.html)

> With LKL, the kernel code is compiled into an object file that can be directly linked by applications.

> LKL is implemented as an architecture port in arch/lkl. It relies on host operations defined by the application or a host library (tools/lkl/lib).

与本站相似的点子。不过我们出发点是用户态复用内核 C 库，且臆想一份代码页，内核和用户空间两映射

<br/>

## [LWN: 内核自我保护（Self Protection）项目启动](http://lwn.net/Articles/663361/rss)

> a community of people to work on the various kernel self-protection technologies (most of which are found in PaX and Grsecurity)

华盛顿邮报近日撰文[指 Linux 缺乏安全性](http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2015/11/05/net-of-insecurity-the-kernel-of-the-argument/)。文中引 Linus 言：

"Security in itself is useless. . . . The upside is always somewhere else. The security is never the thing that you really care about."

"If you run a nuclear power plant that can kill millions of people, you don’t connect it to the Internet."

<br/>

## [LKML: Linus 发飙写的丑的代码](http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1510.3/02866.html)

> The above code is sh*t, and it generates shit code. It looks bad, and there's no reason for it.

> All this kind of crap does is to make the code a unreadable mess with code that no sane person will ever really understand what it actually does.

死磕代码，才经得起时间，才托得了信任
