> syzbot reported that bpf_probe_read_kernel() kernel helper triggered
> KASAN report via kasan_check_range() which is not the expected behaviour

> The problem is the additional size overhead from local_lock in
> struct kmem_cache_cpu.  Avoid this by preallocating a larger area.

**[v3: vdso: Use only headers from the vdso/ namespace](http://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20241003152910.3287259-1-vincenzo.frascino@arm.com/)**
